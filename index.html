		<h1>Getting to Know Git: A Guide to the ALA Class</h1>
		<p>This is a resource guide for the upcoming ALA session, "Getting to Know git". 
			In this class we will talk about what git is, why you should use it, and give
			you a brief lesson on how to work with git. </p>

			<p>We will save the last half hour to have people investigate git (and GitHub), 
			with different steps depending on whether you want to use command-line (command-line is
			strongly encouraged but not necessary).</p>

			<p>Feel free to follow any of these steps before class!</p>
