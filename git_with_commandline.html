        <h3 id="mac">Install Git on a Mac</h3>
        <p>There's a chance git is already installed on your Mac! Open up a terminal window and run "git". If you get a long list of commands, you're probably ready to go. If the terminal says something about not knowing what you're talking about, you'll have to install it:</p>
        <p>Go to the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git-scm downloads page</a> and download the newest version of git. When you open up the downloaded installer, the program will walk you through the set up, which is a quick process.</p>
        <p>You can put in some configurations now - these will be added to every project you start on your computer. Open up your Terminal and run:
        	<div class="example">
        	git config --global user.name "your name"
        </div>
        <div class="example">
        	git config --global user.email "your email address"
        </div>
        <p>You're ready to start working with git on your computer! One last thing, though - you'll want to set make it easier to push and pull files to GitHub. You can chooose to do this via http or SSH.</p>
        <h3>Authenticating your computer with GitHub</h3>
        <p> If you're familiar with SSH, you might want to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">set up an SSH key</a> on your computer and add it to your GitHub profile. If you want to use the https protocol instead, you'll have to always give your user name and password. You could use a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/">creditional helper</a> to make this automatic.</p>
        <p>Set up a key to authenticate with GitHub</p>
