        <h3 id="mac">Install Git on a Mac</h3>
        <p>There's a chance git is already installed on your Mac! Open up a terminal window and run "git". If you get a long list of commands, you're probably ready to go. If the terminal says something about not knowing what you're talking about, you'll have to install it:</p>
        <p>Go to the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git-scm downloads page</a> and download the newest version of git. When you open up the downloaded installer, the program will walk you through the set up, which is a quick process.</p>
        <p>You can put in some configurations now - these will be added to every project you start on your computer. Open up your Terminal and run:
        	<div class="example">
        	git config --global user.name "your name"
        </div>
        <div class="example">
        	git config --global user.email "your email address"
        </div>
        <p>You're ready to start working with git on your computer! One last thing, though - you'll want to set up a SSH key on your computer and add that to your GitHub account. That way you can push and pull projects between your computer and GitHub with ease.</p>
        <h3>Set up an SSH key to authenticate with GitHub</h3>
        <p>If you run the following command, it will create a key on your computer <span class="note"> If you think you already have a key, you can run ls -al ~/.ssh to see if it's there - if it is, skip to the copying step</span></p>
        	<div class="example">
        		ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
        	</div>
        	<p>Click enter to accept the defaults. If you choose to use a passphrase, keep it short! You should see a statement about your public information and key being saved.</p>
        	<p>The next step is to copy this information so you can paste it into your GitHub account settings. Because of the nature of the key, you'll probably want to use a special command to copy the key (as opposed to opening up the document in a text editor and copying it from there).
        		<h4>Copying on a Mac</h4>
        		<div class="example">
        			pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        		</div>
        	<h4>Copying on a PC</h4>
        	<div class="example">
			  clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
			</div> 
           <p class="note">If "clip" doesn't work on your PC, try: <strong>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</strong></p>
