         <h3>Mac</h3>
          <p>If you're on a mac and want to work on a GUI, you'll have several options (<a href="http://git-scm.com/download/gui/mac">see a git GUIs for mac</a> on the official git site), but to get you started, the GitHub GUI client is quick and easy, and works for the purpose of this class.</p>
          <p>To install the GitHub Mac GUI, <a href="https://mac.github.com/">download the GUI from the  GitHub site</a>. Once you open up the tool, it will ask for your GitHub user name and password. It's pretty self-explanatory, but you can <a href="https://mac.github.com/help.html">look to the help guide</a> for more instructions if needed.
